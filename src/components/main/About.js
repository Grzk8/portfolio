            <p className={'about_text'}>
                I`m a web developer. Programming is my passion and I`m working on front-end technologies like JavaScript and React. At the same time I`m also diving into back-end technologies NodeJS, SQL, MongoDB; building full stack applications.
            </p>
            <p className={'about_text'}>
                I would like to develop my skills learning new technologies and expand the horizons, so I`m looking for the first professional experience that will enable me to do this.
            </p>
